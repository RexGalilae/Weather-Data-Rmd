This work was done as a part of a project towards the completion of the [Reproducible Research](http://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research) course in the [Data Science Specialization](http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). This `knitr` generated publication documents all the work done (in R) towards the completion of said project.
